This blog was created using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It is an easy way to write blogposts with Markdown. I will be performing data science investigations on this blog by converting Jupyter Notebooks directly to markdown. Posts will all be in a literate programming style. I will be using Python 2.7 and making use of Pandas/Numpy extensively.
